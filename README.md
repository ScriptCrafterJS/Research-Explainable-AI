# Explainable AI for File Type Classification in Digital Forensics
This project explores the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to enhance transparency and trust in digital forensicsâ€”specifically in the task of classifying file fragments during image carving.
We analyze and evaluate the SIFT (Sifting File Types) framework, which combines:

- TF-IDF for byte-level feature extraction
- LIME & SHAP for model interpretability
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for multiclass file classification

The paper highlights how integrating XAI enables more transparent, legally defensible AI models in forensic investigations, improving both accuracy and credibility when dealing with fragmented or metadata-less digital evidence.
